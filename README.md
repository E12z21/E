## Log

v0.5 - So, added mre functionality to JARVIS, specified in the release notes. The biggest out of them was the timetabler capability. JARVIS can now note down events and remind you when an event is coming up soon (over the next 2-3 days). Also een working on the JARVIS website, the JARVIS docs and the JARVIS GUI, seperate repositories for those. Still Need to add - 

- create reports (health reports, usage reports, inspired by iOS' Screen Usage report)
- Export the JARVIS assistant as .exe for easier installation
- Automation of multiple tasks at once (e.g. - 'Open microsoft word, then search "how to write a story" using chrome')
- File Manipulation (e.g. open, read, write, edit and save files)
- Database filled with answers to questions used in conversational speech (not a necessity)
- Recommendations (health recommendations, weather recommendations, etc.)
- Email Manipulation (Able to open, read, write, edit and send emails. This is not a necessity)

## In Depth

JARVIS is currently (v0.5) split into several modules, each of which is in the JARVIS folder. You can check them out, also adding information to these modules on the JARVIS Docs.
